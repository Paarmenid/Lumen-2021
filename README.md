# Lumen-2021
A part of the solution for Lumen 2021 student competition. The code presented is not the final solution. It's the model training and the model execution part of the solution. The final solution was designed as one python script starting the creation of a dataset from which the model training part (one of the Jupyter notebooks in this repository) solution starts. The creation of the dataset part included loading the original dataset given by competition designers, doing extensive data cleaning and analysis, and finally creating a filtered dataset used for model training.

Also missing is maybe the most important step which included extensive exploratory analysis done by our team in multiple Jupyter notebooks. The most important results are incorporated into project documentation (the solution pdf). After data exploration, data cleaning, and final dataset generation, the model was trained and then evaluated on new data points. This was all part of a unified python script with implemented interface through which parameters of new data points are given. The code in this repository works on our generated dataset, and with test data generated on this dataset. The final solution was generalized so it can take a new dataset as an input (the parameters given through the user interface) and generate the result explained in the solution. I did not upload the code for the final solution because it was a team effort and also the results can be seen in the pdf file.
